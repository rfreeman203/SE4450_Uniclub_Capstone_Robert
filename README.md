# SE4450_Uniclub_Capstone_Robert

The purpose of this repository is to show my contribution to my software engineering capstone. This repo was committed with permission from the proper IP owner in order to showcase my experience with JavaScript, ReactJS and software methodologies. The permissions granted allow me to show my individual contribution to the capstone and showcase these pages in a live demo. UniClub is a learning management system built using modern web development technologies such as ReactJS, Material UI, and REST API used to build the LMS and MongoDB used for backend. Through the duration of the project I had many responsibilities including; developing several web pages, creation of dynamic pages, creation of functionality for modifying/viewing courses, creation of a temporary backend, creation of dynamic pages/files/assestments, integration to permanent backend. This project was completed with agile methodologies having weekly and monthly sprints to ensure task completion and cohesion.
